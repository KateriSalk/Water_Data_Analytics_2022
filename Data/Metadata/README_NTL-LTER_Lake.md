# NTL-LTER Lake Datasets


## Summary
This dataset was prepared for Water Data Analytics at Duke University, Spring 2022

The dataset contains data from studies on several lakes in the North Temperate Lakes District in Wisconsin, USA. Data were collected as part of the Long Term Ecological Research station established by the National Science Foundation.

## Database Information
Data were collected from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research website. More information can be found here: https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/about/overview

Data were collected using the Data tool (https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/data).
From the Data homepage, the following selections were made: 
* Cascade (NTL Categories)
* Cascade Project at North Temperate Lakes LTER Core Data Physical and Chemical Limnology 1984 - 2016
* Download All Data (csv)

csv files were saved as  `NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv`

### Physical and chemical limnology
Physical and chemical variables are measured at one central station near the deepest point of each lake. In most cases these measurements are made in the morning (0800 to 0900). Vertical profiles are taken at varied depth intervals. Chemical measurements are sometimes made in a pooled mixed layer sample (PML); sometimes in the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion; and sometimes in vertical profiles. In the latter case, depths for sampling usually correspond to the surface plus depths of 50percent, 25percent, 10percent, 5percent and 1percent of surface irradiance.

Methods for 1984-1990 were described by Carpenter and Kitchell (1993) and methods for 1991-1997 were described by Carpenter et al. (2001).
